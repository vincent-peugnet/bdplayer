# BD Player Comic Strip and Audio Web Player

## Introduction

Welcome to my BD player Project.

It's suposed to be a very easy to use Comic strip player

## Inputs

It's a audio / image player.

There is two folders `/img` and `/sound` Where you have to put your images and sound files.

The Name has to be a three letters string, for example : `001.jpg` or `025.mp3`.

The image is prioritary over sound. You can't have a missing numer beetween two images but you can have very separated or even no sound at all.
